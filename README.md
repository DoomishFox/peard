# pear üçê
pear is a simple local network discovery and sharing application.

## broadcast
broadcast is sent to the subnet broadcast address to request client callbacks. These callbacks will include the client's public key which will be used to sign? any shared slices.

## slices
I'm gonna call the things that are shared slices (you know, cause fruit? get it? I'm so funny). slices can be text content, like a url, or maybe even images. We'll see how that will work (I have no idea yet).
